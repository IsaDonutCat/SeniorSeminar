# SeniorSeminar
Repository for Q3 Senior Seminar coding assignment. 
# The ranking system is as follows:
- The first student to submit gets all their choices, in the order they submitted them. So the first slot has their first choice, etc.
- The second student to submit first gets their choices searched to see if they have any matches with the first student. If they do, they are put in the same seminar. Any choices that aren't a match are attempted to fit into the empty slots. If the presenter of a seminar is already occupied at that time, or they already have two sessions, the next unique choice is put in that slot. If there's no fit, they are assigned to an empty seminar at that time.
